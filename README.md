You are required to work in small groups to develop a contemporary and accessible website that
includes a Web Form to validate contact and other details. The website should contain multiple pages.
Students are required to apply the key concepts and methods covered during the module HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and relevant frameworks (such as jQuery) to implement dynamic interactive design
and event-handling techniques (for example, animation, image effects, extensive form validation,
etc.). Students will incorporate the knowledge of UX design and apply the principles to develop the
HTML structure to consider interactivity, accessibility features, as well as including coding for
validation of user input. The website should be standards-compliant and is capable of gathering and
conditioning data supplied by a user. Users should be able to browse all the information. Dynamic
interactive design and event handling techniques (for example, animations, banners, image effects,
date/time, form validation, calculator, and cookies/LocalStorage) are required.
